You might ask: "Why did you start a blog?".
Well, the answer might be not really looking very exciting.

I want a place to rant. A place what can be accessed only if somebody wants to and has link (I will post link on my osu! profile "me!" section soon). I really wanted to separate it from, for example, my twitter account or mentioned earlier osu! profile "me!" section. Separate my personal thoughts about life and maybe self-deprecating babbling from being a player; a player, who has carved his ranks amount, his ranked score amount and few other things.

I want to mention that in this moment I am listening to my music playlist on youtube. I would like to say something about it in the future..., so let's leave this topic for another post.

First post may mean...
How to start it?
In the moment of writing this first post I feel somehow like I am talking... I believe that humans need some sort of social interaction. You can even observe this need in animal behavior. So I wanted to talk.

Why?

Because I am lonely...

Maybe let's start how this day looked. 23rd of November 2020.
I went to my job early morning, I said "hi" to coworkers, I explained in few sentences what I am doing when boss and later our "manager" asked me, during "lunch break" I didn't say a work except responding "thank you" when somebody entered social room and said polish equivalent of "Enjoy your meal". I nodded as always when my coworker, let's call him "M", was talking about how he had troubles to set up a machine to work properly. Oh, I remember now. I said to my female coworker "B" - "I see that you dyed your hair". And then she started talking for like a minute while I nodded few times. I remember also asking coworker "K" - "Should I do that now?". I might also said few "yes" or "no" but I am not sure. On the end of a day I said "goodbye" to my coworkers.
After work I remember exchanging like 7-8 SMS messages with my mum.

You know what, actually during writing this I realized - I should value these interactions with my coworkers more.
If you read this day description, you might think - why is he complaining?
Hmm, now I agree.
I am sorry.

...

You know what?
Actually I will complain about something related to this tomorrow.

As for first post I feel satisfied that I can still write longer sentences... And ashamed of myself because while wanting to present arguments how I am lonely I actually presented some sort of counterargument. That happens too often and then people might think about me as a lier. But that is so common that I am digging my own grave during conversation that I prefer to just nod instead of talk. 

How do you think? Did I lose in this post?

(Sorry for poor use of english or grammar mistakes)

Anyway, let's hope to meet tomorrow!

Take care,
