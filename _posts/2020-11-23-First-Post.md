title: My first post - #2 attempt
---
You might ask: "Why did you start a blog?".
Well, the answer might be not really looking very exciting.

I want a place to rant. A place what can be accessed only if somebody wants to and has link (I will post link on my osu! profile "me!" section soon). I really wanted to separate it from, for example, my twitter account or mentioned earlier osu! profile "me!" section. Separate my personal thoughts about life and maybe self-deprecating babbling from being a player; a player, who has carved his ranks amount, his ranked score amount and few other things.

I want to mention that in this moment I am listening to my music playlist on youtube. I would like to say something about it in the future..., so let's leave this topic for another post.

First post may mean...
How to start it?
In the moment of writing this first post I feel somehow like I am talking... I believe that humans need some sort of social interaction. You can even observe this need also in animal behavior. So I wanted to talk.

Why?

Well...

Maybe you can find answer basing on my future posts.

(Disclaimer)
I wasn't satisfied with part that started here that I previously wrote, so I deleted it. That's why I named this post "#2 attempt".

(Sorry for poor use of english or grammar mistakes)

Take care,
